# Image-processing-with-Fourier-Transform

I developed an image processing application in C, using the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), designed to run on the Analog Devices Blackfin BF533 processor. I applied the DFT to a grayscale 8x8 image, visualized its amplitude and phase spectra, and reconstructed the image using the inverse DFT (IDFT). I also applied Butterworth low-pass and high-pass filters in the frequency domain to observe their effects on the image.
